Roll20-TMNT-Template
====================

A repo of the files needed to add a TMNT character sheet to Roll20

Some notes:

The TMNT system shows its age in places, compared to the rest of Palladium games.  My recommendation is to use skills, martial arts and combat from Ninjas and Superspies instead.  It dovetails pretty smoothly into the existing system.  

I also always found the Bio-E a little unfair as is in the system.  I made it easier for my players, giving them size level 8 and 60 Bio-E to spend on Hands, Bipedal, Speech, Looks, Psionics, Animal Perks and additional Size Levels.  I say have fun with it and run the numbers that you like most in your campaign  :)
